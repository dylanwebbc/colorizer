Color black and white images using a deep neural network

The model runs with 30 separate U-Nets, 10 for each of red, green and blue. A black and white inage goes in, and the ten successive models color the photo in the specific colorband. The final red, green and blue images are combined to form a final predicted photo. To learn more, read the project report :)
